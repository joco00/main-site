First week here in New York City. I moved in on monday January 3rd into a small apartment on the 10th floor.  
I have two roomates, very diferent than me, that I have gotten along with and hope to continue to. They are both
quite outgoing people while I am the opposite in nature.

This week has been anything but crazy, mostly lazy. Watching movies, hanging with my freind in mid town until 8am, and sleeping until 2pm.
I feel as if people first moving to the city would have been out partying while im mostly hanging in apartents doing nothing. Ive spent almost every hour this week
inside. Its sad to me because thats normal me, not a new me that I want. Its the beggining im not going to sit in my apartment forever. Plus Its winter and
I have to start work next week. There is no rush, I have plenlty of amazing times infront of me.

It took more mental energy than expected to move then settle in. From organizing my stuff to ordering things like a lamp and desk,
to figuring out what im going to do for food, its exhausting.
