Ok its bullshit trying to deal with build issues on Gatsby.  
The problem is with the sharp plugin for fast image rendering.
The plugin just doesnt build and there are no resources online
to fix the problem.  
My solution. Make a whole new project and just all the files to
the new project. Ya it work. Why... I dont know and I dont really
care rn.
