Ok its bullshit trying to deal with sharp plugin build issue on Gatsby.  
The plugin just doesnt build and there are no resources online
to fix the problem. My solution. Make a whole new project and just copy all the files to
the new project.  
Ya it works. Why... I dont know and I dont really
care rn.
