This is my first blog post!  
This site was built using Gatsby, React, GraphQL and Mdx.
The goal is to gain experience creating beautiful, reusable and constructable UI components
as well as to maintain a simple blog.

I choose to use Gatsby beacuse it offered me an easily hostable static site that is easily
integrated with React. It seems like an option but I have already run into some annoying problems
so time will tell.
